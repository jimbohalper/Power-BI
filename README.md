# Power-BI Final Project
Using the Power Query Engine in Power BI, I carried out data cleaning on a few columns.
For example, the salary column, I separated the column, using delimiters, to the highest salary and the lowest salary of the selected range.
After that, I changed the datatype of both columns to integer and found the average of both values.
